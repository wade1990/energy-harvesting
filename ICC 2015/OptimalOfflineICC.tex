We consider an off-line scenario, which means we know all $t_i$'s and $\ETx_i$'s, non causally. We assume that the receiver harvests energy only once (say of amount $E$) at time $r_0=0$. Hence, the receiver (and so does the transmitter) can be \textit{on} for a maximum period of $\TRx_0=\frac{E}{P_r}$. We also assume that an infinite battery capacity is available both at the transmitter and the receiver to store the harvested energy. Our objective is to complete transmission (transmit $B_0$ bits) as early as possible. This is stated as an optimization problem below.

%The transmitter is supposed to transmit all $B_0$ bits in as minimum time as possible. The problem is formally stated below.
\begin{problem}
\begin{align}
&\min_{\{\textbf{p},\textbf{s},N\}}			&& T
\\
&\text{subject to} 				&& B(T)=B_0, 
\label{pb1_constraint_bits}
\\
&     										&& U(t)\le \mathcal{E}(t)  		&&& \forall \; t\;\in\;[0,T], \label{pb1_constraint_energy}
\\
&    										&& \displaystyle\sum_{\mathclap{i=1:p_i\neq 0}}^{N}(s_{i+1}-s_i)\le \TRx_0.
\label{pb1_constraint_time}
\end{align}
\end{problem}
Constraint \eqref{pb1_constraint_energy} means that we cannot use more than available energy at any point of time till we finish transmission. \eqref{pb1_constraint_time} implies that the maximum duration of transmission cannot exceed $\TRx_0$. Note that the maximum transmission duration would reduce to $(s_{N+1}-s_1)$, as we shall see in Lemma \ref{lemma_nobreaks}.  

Before describing an algorithm to solve Problem 1, we state the following Lemmas, which shall help us construct our algorithm.
