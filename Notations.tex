The Transmitter energy arrival instants are marked by $t_i$'s with energy $E^{T}_i$ while the receiver energy arrivals are marked by $r_i$'s with energy $E^{R}_i$ for $i \in \{0,1..\}$. The receiver spends $p$ amount of power to be \textit{on} and no power when it is \textit{off}. Hence each energy arrival $E^{R}_i$ can be viewed as it adds $T^{R}_i=\dfrac{E^{R}_i}{p}$ amount of time for which the receiver can be \textit{on}. The maximum amount of time for which the receiver (and hence the Transmitter) can be \textit{on} till time '.' is given by function $T^{R}(.)$. It can be easily seen that $T^{R}(t)=\sum_{i=0}^{r_i<t}T^{R}_i$. Similarly the maximum energy harvested at the transmitter till time '$t$' is given by function $E^{T}(t)=\sum_{i=0}^{t_i<t}E^{T}_i$.
