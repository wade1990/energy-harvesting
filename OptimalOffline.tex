To begin with, we solve the following problem.
\subsection{Problem 1:}
 The receiver harvests energy only once at the beginning. The transmitter, however harvests energy at different times. We exactly know the amount of energy and the time instances of all future harvests at the beginning of process.  We are supposed to transmit $B_0$ bits which is also known beforehand. The problem is to minimize the total time of transmission of all $B_0$ bits subject to certain feasibility constraints as formally stated below.
\begin{align}
&\min_{\{\textbf{p},\textbf{s},N\}}			&& T
\\
&\text{\textit{subject to}} 				&& B(T)=B_0
\\
&     										&& U(t)\le \mathcal{E}(t),  		&&& \forall 0\le t\le T
\\
&    										&& s_{N+1}-s_1\le \mathcal{R}_0
\end{align}

Before describing and proving the optimal algorithm to solve Problem 1 we state the following Lemmas which would be useful in later proofs and also give us an intuitive insight of the algorithm.
