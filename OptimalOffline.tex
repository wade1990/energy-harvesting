We consider an off-line scenario, where we know all $t_i$'s and $\ETx_i$'s, non-causally. We assume that the receiver harvests energy only once at time $r_0=0$. Hence, the receiver (and so does the transmitter) can be \textit{on} for a maximum period of $\TRx_0$. We also assume that an infinite battery capacity is available both at the transmitter and receiver to store the harvested energy. The objective is to find a policy which sends a total of $B_0$ bits to the receiver in as minimum finish time as possible. The optimization problem is stated below.

%The transmitter is supposed to transmit all $B_0$ bits in as minimum time as possible. The problem is formally stated below.
\begin{problem}
\begin{align}
&\min_{\{\textbf{p},\textbf{s},N\}}			&& T
\\
&\text{\textit{subject to}} 				&& B(T)=B_0, 
\label{pb1_constraint_bits}
\\
&     										&& U(t)\le \mathcal{E}(t),  		&&& \forall 0\le t\le T, \label{pb1_constraint_energy}
\\
&    										&& s_{N+1}-s_1\le \mathcal{R}_0.
\label{pb1_constraint_time}
\end{align}
\end{problem}
Before describing an algorithm to solve Problem 1, we state the following Lemmas which would be useful in later proofs and also give us an intuitive insight of the algorithm.
